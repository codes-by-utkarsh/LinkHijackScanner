# LinkHijackScanner
A Python-based Social Media Broken Link Scanner that crawls a given website, extracts social media profile links (LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter/X), and checks if they are valid.  This tool helps identify broken or hijackable social media links that attackers could exploit for account hijacking or brand impersonation.
